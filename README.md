# WGSExtract-Historical
The initial, first year WGS Extract Beta releases by Marko B from May 2019 through Feb 2020

To hold the releases and any notes on Marko's first 9 months of releases and support. 

Note that the releases themselves included the Reference Genomes and similar multi-gigabyte files which would exceed any limits set by GITHub for storing here.  So you will have to get the complete package .zip release from Randy's Google Drive archive that has been supporting the tool. This is just mainly the Python source that Marko distributed for historical reasons. 

Marko never checked in the modifications required to create the CygWin WIn10 port of the Bioinformatic tools like samtools, bcftools, etc; as well as the Python port with its pre-installed libraries. This was all hand developed and the result simply part of the release.  It is not recreatable by anything in this repository.  

This work has all been reset with the new release a year later which is in the main [WGS Extract repository](https://WGSExtract.github.com/WGSExtract/ "WGS Extract") here.
